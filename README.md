## Description

### Motivation for creating this project
  I wanted to practice my javascript skills by learning how to use node.js and build an application outside of a web browser.

### My "WHY" for creating this project
  I have created a slew of README.md files and I figured that I could make a README generator that could help me produce some high quality readme files.

### What problem does this solve?
  This will save time by asking the user a few questions about their project and combine their thoughts into a professional README.md.


## Installation
  To use this project download this code on your computer. Run "npm install" and then call "node index.js "
